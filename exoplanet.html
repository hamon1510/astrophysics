        <h1>Exoplanet Detection Methods</h1>
        <p>Exoplanet detection is a critical field of study in astronomy, enabling scientists to explore and understand worlds that exist beyond our solar system. Since the discovery of the first exoplanet, <strong>51 Pegasi b</strong>, in 1995, the methods used to detect these distant planets have advanced significantly. This planet, which orbits a star similar to our Sun, marked the beginning of an era of planet hunting beyond our solar system. Today, thanks to the work of astronomers and space telescopes, we now know that there are more planets than stars in our galaxy. The <strong>Kepler Space Telescope</strong> estimated that there are over 1 trillion planets in the Milky Way alone. Small planets, especially those that are similar in size to Earth, appear to be relatively common, making the search for Earth-like worlds more promising than ever before.</p>

        <p>One of the key methods used to detect exoplanets is <strong>radial velocity</strong>, also known as the <strong>"wobble method."</strong> This technique tracks the slight movement of a star caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet. The first planet discovered in this way, <strong>51 Pegasi b</strong>, is a gas giant roughly half the size of Jupiter. It orbits its star incredibly quickly, taking only four days to complete one orbit. This rapid orbit causes the star to move slightly back and forth, or "wobble," in response to the planet’s gravity. The <strong>wobble method</strong> became the standard technique for planet hunting for many years, and as astronomers refined their methods of detecting these small changes in stellar motion, they were able to find more hot gas giants similar to 51 Pegasi b. The discovery of such planets has helped increase our understanding of planetary systems far beyond our own.</p>
            
        <p>Another important detection method is <strong>transits</strong>. This occurs when a planet passes in front of its host star, causing a brief dip in the star’s brightness. The <strong>Kepler Space Telescope</strong> played a pivotal role in the “modern” era of exoplanet discovery by focusing on a single region of the sky for four years. During this time, Kepler studied over <strong>150,000</strong> stars and observed the dimming of light caused by planets transiting across their stars. By carefully measuring the amount of light that dims and how long it takes for the planet to pass in front of the star, scientists can calculate important details about the planet, including its orbital period (the time it takes to orbit its star) and the mass of its host star. In 2018, NASA launched a satellite called <strong>TESS</strong> (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) to use this same method to find exoplanets by monitoring a wider area of the sky.</p>
            
        <p>A more advanced technique is <strong>transit spectroscopy</strong>, which allows scientists to analyze the light that passes through a planet’s atmosphere during a transit. Just like a rainbow splits light into its different colors, light that travels through a planet’s atmosphere is altered by the gases present. By studying how this light changes, astronomers can determine which molecules are in the planet’s atmosphere, such as helium, water vapor, and other chemical compounds. The <strong>Hubble Space Telescope</strong> has already been able to detect these gases in exoplanet atmospheres, and the <strong>James Webb Space Telescope</strong>, which launched in 2021, is expected to provide even more detailed information about the composition of exoplanet atmospheres, bringing us closer to understanding whether any of these planets could be habitable.</p>
            
        <p>Another method, <strong>gravitational microlensing</strong>, uses a phenomenon first predicted by Albert Einstein. <strong>Gravitational microlensing</strong> occurs when a star with a planet in orbit passes in front of another star. The gravity of the first star acts as a lens, magnifying the light from the background star. If the first star has a planet, this causes a secondary spike in light, which can be detected by astronomers. This method is incredibly useful for detecting exoplanets that are far away and otherwise difficult to find. The <strong>Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</strong>, set to launch in 2027, will use gravitational microlensing to detect exoplanets that might be missed by other methods.</p>
            
        <p>Finally, <strong>direct imaging</strong> involves taking actual pictures of exoplanets, but this is a challenging task, as most exoplanets do not emit their own light. However, some large, hot gas giants can be bright enough to be captured in images. While most exoplanet images have been taken of gas giants, future advancements in technology will allow scientists to take pictures of smaller, cooler planets as well. One important development is the <strong>coronagraph</strong>, a tool designed to block out the light of a star, allowing astronomers to observe planets in its orbit. The <strong>Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</strong> will also use a coronagraph, making it one of the most advanced telescopes for direct imaging of exoplanets. Additionally, a <strong>starshade</strong> is a device shaped like a sunflower that can block the light of a star and reveal planets orbiting it. NASA is currently working to improve the design of the starshade, with the goal of testing it on future missions <strong>(NASA, “How We Find and Characterize - NASA Science”)</strong>.</p>
